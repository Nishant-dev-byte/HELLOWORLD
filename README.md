## Problem Statement
Currently, Situational Reports (SITREPs) are created manually, either written or dictated by soldiers under high-pressure conditions. Continuous monitoring of surveillance feeds leads to fatigue and increases the likelihood of missing critical details. Accurately identifying emotions, behaviors, or potential hostile actions without technological assistance is challenging. The core problem is the lack of automated, real-time tools that can generate SITREPs, analyze threats, and predict suspicious activities, which limits the ability of soldiers to make faster, safer, and more reliable operational decisions.
